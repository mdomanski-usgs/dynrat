# Installing Python
This assumes you'll be installing a new Python 3.7 environment as the primary
Python environment on your machine. **Following these steps may cause trouble
if other applications on your machine depend on a particular system-wide
version of Python.** There are other options, but they are not covered here.

## Download Python
Go to the [Python downloads page][1] and download the installer for the latest
release of the Python 3.7. As of this writing, the latest version is 3.7.9.

## Install Python
Run the installer. You may install Python using the "Just me" option if you
don't have admin rights on your machine. **Be sure to mark the option to
include this installed version on PATH.**

## Test the Python install
To be sure you have Python 3.7 up and running, open up a Command Prompt and
type in the following line. After installing the environment in this section of
the tutorial, you should get similar output as shown below.

```
>python --version
Python 3.7.9
```
