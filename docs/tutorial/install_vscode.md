# Installing Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code (VSCode), not to be confused with Visual Studio, is an open
source IDE developed and released by Microsoft. If you're comfortable with and
prefer other IDEs, you may skip this section.

## Download VSCode
Go to the [Visual Studio Code download page][1] and download the latest version
of VSCode.

## Install VSCode
Run the VSCode installer. Install it for user profile only. **Do not install it
for all users.**

## Test the VSCode install
From a command prompt, type in the following line. After installing VSCode, you
should get similar output as shown below.

```
>code --version
1.44.2
ff915844119ce9485abfe8aa9076ec76b5300ddd
x64
```

To run VSCode, either type `code` in the command line or start Visual Studio
Code from the start menu.

## Install the Python extension
The VSCode Python extension provides a lot of Python development support.
After opening a Python source file for the first time, VSCode will recommend
that you install the Python extension. You can either install the extension
this way or visit [this site][2] and follow the instructions.
