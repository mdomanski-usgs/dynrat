# Installing Git
Git is a key component to a source, or version, control management system. Git
allows you to make copies of, or clone, remote repositories hosted on sites
like GitHub, GitLab, and code.usgs.gov. Git must be installed and accessible on
your machine in order for you to clone a repository on code.usgs.gov.

## Download Git
Download the latest version of the installer from the [Git page][1].

## Install Git
Run the installer. If possible, do not install Git for all users. While
installing, select VSCode as your editor.

## Test the Git install
To test the Git install, run the following in the command line. If the install
worked, you will see the version number as the output.

```
>git --version
git version 2.21.0.windows.1
```
