# Check your installation

## Check your Python version
dynrat requires Python 3.7. To check your Python version, open a command prompt
and type the following command.

```
>python --version
```

The output of the command will show the Python version. If the command fails,
or the version shown isn't 3.7, see [Installing python](install_python.md).

## Check for an IDE
If you are going to be editing code, it is generally recommended that you use
an IDE. If you don't plan on editing or viewing code, you may skip this step.

There is no requirement of which IDE to use, but if you aren't familiar with an
IDE, I recommend using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). To see if VSCode is
installed, you can either start search for it from the Windows Start menu, or
you can type the following command into the command prompt to start the
program.

```
>code
```

If you're unable to locate VSCode on your system, see
[Installing Visual Studio Code](install_vscode.md).

## Check for a Git installation
You must have Git installed in order to clone the remote dynrat repository. To
see if Git is installed on your system, type the following command into a
command prompt.

```
>git --version
```

This will display the version of Git installed on your system. If the command
fails, see [Installing Git](install_git.md).

Return to [Setting up the development environment](setup.md).
